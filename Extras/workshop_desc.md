[h1] Holidayzone 🎄 - Alpha Release (BZCC Beta Patch REQUIRED) [/h1]
A Christmas-themed conversion mod for Battlezone: Combat Commander. This early build introduces some playable yule vehicles & weapons, a few seasonal winter map variants, and unique Christmas environments & decorations across the Battlezone.

[quote] 🛑 NOTE: The latest Beta Patch of BZCC (203+) is required to play this mod. We recognize that not everyone is playing on this version, and will be making a later attempt to make it compatible for current release of the game. We encourage players to take a second and install it using the following guide: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3417282213]How To Switch To Beta Patch[/url], and use the code [b]SurpiseUpdate2[/b]. The BZCC Beta includes so many new and exciting features that you shouldn't miss out on! [/quote]
