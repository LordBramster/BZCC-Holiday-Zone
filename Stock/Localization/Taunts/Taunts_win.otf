Victory rings brighter than sleigh bells tonight.
The frost bows before your fire... well won.
Your might glows warm enough to shame the winter.
Even the North Wind applauds your triumph.
You stood tall as snowstorms broke around you.
A shining victory carved in ice and courage.
The blizzard yields; your legend grows.
