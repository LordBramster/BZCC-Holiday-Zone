One traveler abandons the trail... storms break the boldest spirits.
Another soldier wanders off into the white silence.
Farewell, wanderer. May the frost treat you kindly.
They slip away like a whisper across frozen dunes.
One less heartbeat echoes through the drifting dark.
Gone... like Santa's cookie stash on Christmas Eve.
