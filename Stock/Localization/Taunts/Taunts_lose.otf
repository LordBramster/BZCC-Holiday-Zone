The blizzard bested us today... no shame in bowing to the storm.
Even the North Pole knows defeat's bitter taste.
Our fire dimmed, our courage iced... we fall this round.
So ends our sleigh ride... overturned in the snow.
The cold claims victory, and we stand humbled.
Our hopes crack like frozen steel... but they'll mend.
