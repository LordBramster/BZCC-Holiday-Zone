Even Santa'd tell you to aim straighter.
The tundra whispers doubt... and it sounds like your footsteps.
Is this war or just a badly thrown snowball fight?
Even Santa questions your aim from the North Pole.
The tundra whispers doubts with every misstep.
Cold winds judge your strategy harsher than I do.
Your engines wheeze like reindeer overdue for retirement.
The frost nips at your heels... move or freeze.
If this keeps up, I'm calling in the elves.
Snow's falling, and so are you.
