A fresh face trudges through the snowdrift... welcome.
Another soul braves the winter war. Bundle up.
You've stepped into the cold... may your aim burn brighter than the frost.
New blood on the tundra... Santa's watching.
A stranger enters the blizzard. May fortune not freeze your fingers.
Hark! Reinforcements arrive wrapped in frost and folly.
