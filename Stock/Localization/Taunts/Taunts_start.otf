The winter drums begin... march with caution.
Steel and snow meet; let the battle wake.
The frost watches as engines roar to life.
Raise your spirits; the storm rises too.
Step lightly, for the ice beneath us remembers.
A new clash dawns across the frozen plains.
The blizzard parts, revealing our fate... fight on.
